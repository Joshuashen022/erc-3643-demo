# ERC-3643 vs ERC-20: A Paradigm Comparison

To understand how ERC-3643 differs from ERC-20, it's essential to examine two fundamental subjects: how **permissioned token design** deviates from traditional permissionless token standards, and how **compliance-embedded systems** depart from conventional regulatory-agnostic approaches.

## Permissionless vs Permissioned Systems

Most publicly accessible tokens use a **permissionless model** like ERC-20, where anyone can create, transfer, or receive tokens without restrictions. This design mirrors Ethereum's core tenets of censorship resistance and open access. Anyone who has interacted with DeFi protocols or public token sales will be familiar with this system.

ERC-3643 takes a fundamentally different approach, implementing a **permissioned framework** in place of open access. Through its evolution from previous security token standards, the protocol has enhanced this model: it introduces on-chain identity verification, modular compliance engines, and real-time regulatory enforcement while maintaining core token functionality.

At a high level, ERC-3643 replaces the unrestricted transfers of ERC-20 with a **compliance layer** that validates every transaction against regulatory rules. As tokens move between addresses, the system checks identity status, jurisdictional restrictions, and investor qualifications. In this dynamic, a sender doesn't just transfer to a receiver—they interact with a compliance validator that approves or rejects the transaction based on predefined rules. The trade-offs between permissionless and permissioned token models represent an active area of development for institutional blockchain adoption.

## Compliance-Embedded Architecture

The second departure from traditional token standards is the **compliance-by-design** architecture of ERC-3643. These design decisions were inspired by the needs of regulated financial markets, with a commitment to regulatory adherence as an indispensable component of a future where traditional financial instruments can exist on-chain without sacrificing investor protection or legal compliance.

**Permissioned design** means that the token's functionality is selectively restricted based on verified identity and regulatory status. Not everyone can hold or transfer these tokens—only verified participants meeting specific criteria can interact with them. This is a departure from traditional token standards, which typically provide unrestricted access regardless of geography, accreditation status, or regulatory standing.

The protocol is also **upgradeable in a controlled manner**, allowing compliance rules to evolve with changing regulations without requiring token migration. Governance entities can update compliance modules, identity verification thresholds, or transfer restrictions within predefined parameters. However, these capabilities are transparent to all participants, and to prevent abuse, changes typically require multi-signature approval or governance consensus.
